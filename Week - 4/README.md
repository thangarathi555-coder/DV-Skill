Shopify Stock Analysis
Project Overview
This project performs stock market analysis on Shopify (SHOP) stock data using Python. The analysis includes stock price visualization, moving average calculations, and daily return analysis to understand stock performance trends over time.

Objectives
Load and analyze Shopify stock data.
Visualize stock closing prices over time.
Calculate 20-day and 50-day moving averages.
Analyze daily stock returns.
Understand stock market trends using data visualization.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Google Colab
Dataset
The dataset contains Shopify stock market information including:

Date
Closing Price
Other stock-related attributes
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and the date column is converted into datetime format for analysis.

Project Workflow
1. Import Required Libraries
The project uses:

Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
2. Load Dataset
The Shopify stock dataset is loaded from a CSV file and displayed for initial inspection.

3. Stock Price Visualization
A line chart is created to visualize Shopify's closing stock price over time. This helps identify trends and market movements.

4. Moving Average Analysis
The following moving averages are calculated:

20-Day Moving Average (MA20)
50-Day Moving Average (MA50)
These indicators help smooth short-term fluctuations and highlight long-term trends.

5. Daily Return Calculation
Daily stock returns are calculated using percentage change in closing prices.

Formula:

Daily Return (%) = Percentage Change in Closing Price × 100

This metric helps measure day-to-day stock performance.

6. Return Distribution Analysis
A histogram with density estimation is plotted to analyze the distribution of daily returns and understand stock volatility.

Outputs
The project generates:

Shopify stock closing price trend chart
20-day and 50-day moving average chart
Daily return calculations
Daily return distribution histogram
