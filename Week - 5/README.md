Healthcare Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes healthcare dataset records using Python. The analysis focuses on medical codes, hospital stay duration, billing amounts, and patient admission/discharge information. The goal is to gain insights into healthcare operations and patient treatment data.

Objectives
Load and explore healthcare data.
Check for missing values in medical codes.
Standardize medical codes for consistency.
Calculate hospital stay duration.
Analyze billing amount statistics.
Generate descriptive insights from the dataset.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Google Colab
Dataset Features
The dataset contains information such as:

Medical Code
Admission Date
Discharge Date
Billing Amount
Hospital Stay Details
Project Workflow
1. Import Libraries
The project uses:

Pandas for data processing
Matplotlib for visualization
Seaborn for data analysis and plotting
2. Load Dataset
The healthcare dataset is loaded from a CSV file and inspected for data quality.

3. Missing Value Analysis
The Medical_Code column is checked for missing values to ensure data completeness.

4. Medical Code Standardization
Medical codes are standardized by removing the "ICD-10-" prefix, making the data easier to analyze and compare.

5. Hospital Stay Analysis
Admission and discharge dates are converted into datetime format, and hospital stay duration is calculated.

Formula:

Hospital Stay Days = Discharge Date − Admission Date

This helps evaluate patient stay periods and hospital resource utilization.

6. Billing Amount Analysis
Descriptive statistics are generated for billing amounts, including:

Count
Mean
Standard Deviation
Minimum Value
Maximum Value
Quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%)
7. Hospital Stay Statistics
Summary statistics are also calculated for hospital stay duration to understand patient hospitalization trends.

Outputs
The project produces:

Medical code frequency analysis
Standardized medical codes
Hospital stay duration calculations
Billing amount statistics
Healthcare dataset summary reports
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how healthcare data can be analyzed using Python. By examining medical codes, hospital stay durations, and billing information, healthcare organizations can better understand operational performance and patient care trends.
